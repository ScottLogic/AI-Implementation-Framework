# AI Framework Configuration
# This YAML file defines the structure and content for the AI framework visualization
# The framework displays AI considerations across different organizational layers and value chain stages

# VALUE CHAIN DEFINITION
# Defines the horizontal columns in the framework grid
# Each stage represents a different phase in the AI value chain
# The 'column' number determines the grid position (1-4 from left to right)
# YAML anchors (&anchor_name) are used to reference these definitions throughout the file
value_chain:
  foundation_model: &foundation_model
    name: 'Foundation Model'    # Column header text
    column: 1                   # Grid position (leftmost)

  applications: &applications
    name: 'Applications'        # Column header text
    column: 2                   # Grid position

  usage: &usage
    name: 'Usage'              # Column header text
    column: 3                   # Grid position

  stakeholders: &stakeholders
    name: 'Stakeholders'       # Column header text
    column: 4                   # Grid position (rightmost)

# FRAMEWORK LAYERS
# Defines the vertical rows of the framework
# Each layer represents a different organizational level or perspective
# Layers are rendered from top to bottom in the order they appear here
layers:
  # CORPORATE GOVERNANCE LAYER
  # Top-level strategic and compliance considerations
  - title: Corporate Governance           # Layer title (displayed vertically)
    class: corporate-governance          # CSS class for styling this layer
    considerations:                      # List of considerations within this layer
      # CONSIDERATION STRUCTURE:
      # - title: Display text for the consideration
      # - value_chain: Starting column (*anchor reference)
      # - value_chain_end: Ending column (optional, for spanning multiple columns)
      # - type: Filter category AND CSS class (all, product, operations, people)
      #   * 'all' = always visible regardless of filter, uses special styling
      #   * 'product' = visible when product filter is active, applies 'product' CSS class
      #   * 'operations' = visible when operations filter is active, applies 'operations' CSS class
      #   * 'people' = visible when people filter is active, applies 'people' CSS class
      #   NOTE: The type value serves dual purpose - both for JavaScript filtering logic
      #         and as a CSS class name applied to the consideration element for styling

# HOW TO UPDATE THIS FILE:
# 1. To add a new layer: Copy an existing layer structure and modify the title, class, and considerations
# 2. To add a new consideration: Add a new item under the appropriate layer's considerations list
# 3. To modify positioning: Change the value_chain reference to position in different columns
# 4. To span multiple columns: Add value_chain_end to specify the ending column
# 5. To change filtering: Modify the type field (all, product, operations, people)
# 6. The framework.html template will automatically render any changes made here
